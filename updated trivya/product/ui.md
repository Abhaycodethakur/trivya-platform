### **File 2: Trivya Platform - End-to-End Client Journey & UI System v3.4** --- 
#### **1. Overview: The Self-Service AI Workforce** 
The Trivya Platform is engineered to make advanced AI-driven customer support automation 
effortless for any company to adopt. Our core philosophy is: **"Make the hardest automation 
look luxuriously simple."** 
This document outlines the complete client journey, from initial discovery on our website to the 
activation and management of their AI workforce. The UI is the central nervous system of this 
journey, designed to be **self-service, transparent, intelligently priced, and wrapped in a 
premium experience** that matches the enterprise value we deliver. --- 
#### **2. The Complete Client Journey Flow** 
The client experience is structured in four distinct phases: 
1. **Discovery & Engagement**: Landing on the website, interacting with our AI, and signing up   
2. **Evaluation & Decision**: Exploring AI variants through luxurious cards, comparison tools, 
and detailed popups   
3. **Activation & Onboarding**: Payment, integration setup, and knowledge ingestion   
4. **Management & Growth**: Using the active dashboard to monitor and control their AI 
workforce

#### **3. Phase 1: Discovery & Engagement (The Landing Experience)** 
**Objective**: Capture leads frictionlessly while providing an unforgettable "Aha!" moment 
through premium design. 
**Main Landing Page:** - **Hero Section Messaging**:   
*"Replace Your 24/7 Support Team for 80% Less. Enterprise-grade AI that works around the 
clock, without the cost of three full-time employees."* - **`[FUTURE]` Social Proof Section (Post-Launch)**:   
*(To be activated once first 5 enterprise clients onboard)*   
Trusted by teams who've fired their 24/7 support staff   
[Client Logo Cloud]   
"Trivya handles 12,000 tickets/day for 150+ companies"   
[Pulsing Gold Badge] ✓ SOC 2 Type II | ✓ GDPR Ready   
*Hover interaction: Each logo shows 1-sentence result* - **`[NEW]` Luxurious Color Palette**:   
Deep charcoal foundation (#0A0A0B) with warm gold accents (#D4AF37) and electric cyan 
highlights (#00D4FF). All text in soft ivory (#F5F5F0) for maximum readability and premium feel. - **`[NEW]` Subtle Moving Background**:   
Slow, parallax particle network animation (low opacity, 0.5 fps) creates a sense of AI neural 
activity without distracting from content. Visible only in hero section; static elsewhere for 
readability. - **`[NEW]` Live AI Demo Widget**:   
Persistent chat widget in bottom-right corner with message: *"Ask our AI anything about 
Trivya."* Connects directly to our own Trivya AI instance, loaded with our documentation. - **`[NEW]` "Dogfooding" Banner**:   
Tasteful gold banner: *"Our support is powered by Trivya AI. Try it yourself."* Builds instant 
trust through transparency. 
**Sign-Up Process:** - **Crucial Field**: Email only for initial access - **Phone Number Collection**: Requested **later**, only when they click "Schedule Demo Call" - **Trust Building**: "We only use your number for the AI demo you request" --- 
#### **4. Phase 2: Evaluation & Decision (The Luxury Card Experience)** 
**Objective**: Convert interest into personalized, fairly-priced commitment through an elegant, 
non-technical comparison—while preventing tier arbitrage. --- 
**`[NEW]` Smart Bundle Visualizer (Above Variant Cards):**

**MINI TRIVYA - "The 24/7 Trainee" Card Summary:** - **"Replaces 3 full-time freshers working 24/7 shifts"** (Hero statement) - **Main Job**: Answers FAQs, tracks orders, prepares refunds, escalates complex issues - **Handles**: Email, chat, social media, SMS, and **2 phone calls at once** - **Critical Limitation**: **CANNOT make decisions** – only collects data for human review - **Auto-saves you**: ~$13,000/month in trainee salaries - **Starts at**:  **$1,000/month**  *(Custom quote after assessment)* - **Best for**: SMBs with 50-200 daily tickets and simple queries 
**TRIVYA - "The Junior Agent" Card Summary:** - **"Replaces 3 junior agents—resolves 70% of issues without you"** (Hero statement) - **Main Job**: Everything Mini does, plus troubleshoots problems and **recommends** refund 
decisions - **Handles**: All channels plus **3 simultaneous calls** - **Key Advantage**: **Thinks for you** – detects patterns, suggests KB updates, cuts review 
time by 80% - **Auto-saves you**: ~$18,000/month in junior agent salaries - **Starts at**:  **$2,500/month**  *(Custom quote after assessment)* - **Best for**: Growing companies with 200-500 daily tickets

**Popup Modal Details (Non-Technical Language + Anti-Arbitrage):** 
When user clicks "See Full Details," a full-screen overlay opens with: 
**Popup Header:** - Large variant name with gold underline animation 
-  **"What This AI Employee Does For You"**  (Benefits-first section) 
**Mini Trivya Popup Content:** - **Scenario**: *"A customer calls at 2 AM asking 'Where's my order?' Mini answers instantly, 
checks Shopify, and texts them the tracking link. Your team sees the full log at 9 AM."* - **Your Channels Covered**: Email ✓ Chat ✓ Instagram/Facebook DMs ✓ SMS ✓ Phone (2 
at once) ✓ - **Smart Escalation**: Knows to pass angry customers, legal questions, or big refunds to your 
team - **Setup**: Connects to Shopify, Zendesk, or your CRM in 10 minutes (guided wizard) - **Safety**: Every action logged; never touches money or private data - **ROI**: Replaces ~$14k/month in trainee salaries for $1-1.5k/month 
**  [NEW] The Hidden Cost Section: ** 
> ** "The Manager's Time Tax" **: Mini collects refund requests but can't decide. Your team 
spends ~5 minutes reviewing each. At 50 refunds/day = ** 4+ hours of manager time daily **.   
> ** Two Minis = Double the Work: ** While 2 Mini Trivyas handle 400 tickets/day (vs Trivya's 
300), you still review every escalation manually.   
> ** Trivya solves this: ** Recommends decisions, cutting review time to 30 minutes/day. ** 
[See Cost-Benefit Analysis] ** --- 
** Trivya Popup Content: ** - ** Scenario**: *"Customer's product won't turn on. Trivya walks them through 5 troubleshooting 
steps, determines it's a real defect, creates a return label, and approves a $30 refund 
automatically."* - **Your Channels Covered**: All Mini's channels + 3 simultaneous calls - **Smart Decisions**: Recommends refunds based on your policy; flags fraud patterns - **Self-Improvement**: Notices 50 people asked the same question this week and suggests a 
new FAQ article - **Setup**: Same 10-min wizard; also learns from your past ticket history - **Safety**: You set refund limits; Trivya never exceeds them - **ROI**: Replaces ~$22k/month in junior agent salaries for $2.5-3k/month 
**[NEW] Why Not Just Stack Minis?** 
> **Capability Lock**: Mini cannot learn patterns or make recommendations. At 200+ 
tickets/day, you need intelligence, not just capacity.   
> **Billing Simplicity**: One Trivya agent = one usage meter. Two Minis = double overage 
calculations.   
> **Upgrade Path**: At 2.5 Mini agents, Trivya becomes cheaper when you factor in manager 
time. --- 
**Trivya High Popup Content:** - **Scenario**: *"VIP customer threatens to cancel over repeated issues. Trivya High reviews 
their history, detects a product flaw pattern, offers a $50 credit, and alerts your product team 
with a full report."* - **Your Channels Covered**: All Trivya's channels + 5 calls + video screen-sharing - **Strategic Intelligence**: Predicts which customers might cancel next month; suggests 
operational fixes - **Enterprise Safety**: Human approval workflows for refunds over $50; real-time supervisor 
monitoring - **Brand Ambassador**: Ingests your manuals, mission statement, and policy docs to speak in 
your exact brand voice - **ROI**: Replaces ~$35k/month in senior agent salaries for $4-6k/month --- 
**Popup CTA Button**:  **"Get My Custom Quote in 2 Minutes"**  *(Closes popup, opens 
assessment form)* --- 
#### **4.5. Anti-Arbitrage Safeguards (Integrated Throughout Journey)** 
**Problem**: Customers may attempt to stack Mini agents instead of upgrading to higher tiers, 
destroying value and creating operational chaos.
